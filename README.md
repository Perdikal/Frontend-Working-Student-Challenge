# Frontend-Working-Student-Challenge

For this coding challenge, I used babel-loader to transpile JavaScript files into plain old JavaScript code supported by older browsers. I did not manage to resize the SVG on window resize, but onresize the chart holds its form and is always readable.

Installation : \$ npm run build

Start: \$ npm run start
